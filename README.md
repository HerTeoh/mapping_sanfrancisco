# Mapping San Francisco
This repository tracks the iterations I go through as I try and map out San Francisco.

## Files
1. **Mapping San Francisco v1** - First attempt at mapping San Francisco ended up with me using SFMTA GTFS data to plot and colour code the Muni transit lines.
2. **BART GTFS Changes** - Examines BART GTFS for inclusion in Mapping SF v2 and found that BART was in the midst of changing the way they published their static GTFS. This notebook demonstrates how their reporting has changed.
